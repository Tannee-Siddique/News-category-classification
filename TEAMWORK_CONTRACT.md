**Expectations**

The time expected for group members to work on ADSC3910 will be a maximum of 20 hours per week (including meetings) unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected.
Each group member's assigned tasks should be completed at least 6 hours prior to the deliverable submission deadline. This will allow ample time for pull requests to be reviewed before submission.
If team members cannot complete their tasks within the maximum weekly hours, members should give notice on Email or Whatsapp at least 12 hours before the deadline to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the deliverables as set out in the instructions.

**Mode of communication**

Team members will have in-person meetings at the TRU OM campus on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. The time set to meet in person would be in between class breaks and will continue for a minimum of 3 hours. In-person meetings will be allocated to know the progress, review and make changes of the project contributed by the team members.
