## Teamwork Contract for ADSC3910 project

## Expectations

Group members working on ADSC3910 are expected to commit up to 20 hours per week, including meetings. If additional time is necessary, it must be agreed upon by the entire team. Each member should complete their assigned tasks at least 6 hours before the deliverable deadline to allow sufficient time for pull request reviews. If a member cannot meet their task requirements within the allotted hours, they must notify the team via email or WhatsApp at least 12 hours before the deadline to determine whether tasks should be redistributed or if additional time should be allocated. All submissions must adhere to the deliverable criteria outlined in the instructions.

## Mode of Communication

Team members will meet in person at the TRU Old main on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Meetings will occur during class breaks and last for a minimum of 3 hours. These meetings will focus on progress updates, reviewing, and making necessary changes to the project contributions.

## Task Management System

In-person meetings, GitHub, and WhatsApp will be the primary tools for communication, idea exchange, task submission, and review. A project board will be established in GitHub to track each member's assigned tasks related to the deliverables. Tasks will be marked as complete once the corresponding deliverable is finalized.

## Reviews

Group members are expected to work on their own branches and submit pull requests to merge their contributions into the main GitHub repository for the project. Members must add teammates as reviewers, ensuring that all pull requests are reviewed by at least one other teammate within 24 hours of submission.

**Breach of Contract**

If a team member fails to adhere to the team contract, the issue should first be addressed through direct discussion within the team. If the breach remains unresolved, the team should escalate the matter to the professor.
