Expectations

The time expected for group members to work on ADSC3910 will be a maximum of 20 hours per week (including meetings) unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected.
Each group member's assigned tasks should be completed at least 6 hours prior to the deliverable submission deadline. This will allow ample time for pull requests to be reviewed before submission.
If team members cannot complete their tasks within the maximum weekly hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 12 hours before the deadline to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the deliverables as set out in the instructions.
